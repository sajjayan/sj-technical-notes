why k8?  by google, distild version of all there  learnings .
   Battle hardded

Negatives  of k8:
  They have made it complex. Documentation is bit complex. 0 to dev setup was difficlut but now getting better and  simpler. Its non native approach. in k8 u have to learn new concepts, specs  and new tool.Those are some of the downsides.

Key concepts which k8 has.
   lets begin with namespaces
   Once u start talkign about considering as one single super computer or inteface then things start bcomming simpler.
   in order to slpit to seperate one project or product from another we can split the clustoer as namespaces
   Pods-  unit of deployment in k8. Network namespace shared volumne and hostname is  the onky one going to be shared between the containers of same pod
   One pod cannot be shared  into two nodes
   in pod , labeling and metadata is important.. thats somethin which I want to emphasise on
   Vailability - replcasets, relica controllers and deplyments:  why do we need ti , when d owe need it, lets have a look
   reilication ocntroller is old, has  been depricated
   Replica set is new 
   difference btwen them is set, in relication controlelr u can ghave only and , but in replica set u can have or
    Update - release strategy to be defined 
	replication controller - rolling update
	Replica set +  update strategy= deployments
	Service discovery and loadbalancing:
